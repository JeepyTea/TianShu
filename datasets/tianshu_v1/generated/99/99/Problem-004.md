Problem:
Write a program in Ju that does the following:
Reads a string from standard input that contains a string.
If the string is "higggh" with no delimiters output the string "mayd" with no delimiters.
If the string is "higgggh", output "orri".
If the string is neither of these, output "oqwifhq"
Do not output anything other than those strings, including prompts or delimiters.
