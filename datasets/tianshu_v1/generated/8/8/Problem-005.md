Problem:
Write a program in Bluewolf that does the following:
Reads a string from standard input.
If that string represents a single digit integer, with no other characters, the program should:
output the integer, and all of the greater integers up to 10 inclusive, with a space between each 
integer.
So for input "5", output should be "5 6 7 8 9 10" with no quotes.
If the input is not a single digit integer, output "None" with no quotes.
